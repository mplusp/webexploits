# Project for IT-Security demo

## Main Website

### Setup

Run `docker compose up` from the `main-website` directory. Later on, all the different parts of this project, should be combined and be started with `docker compose up` from the project's root directory.

### Starting the Website

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your favorite browser. This will probably also change in the future and probably be automated somehow in the final project release.
